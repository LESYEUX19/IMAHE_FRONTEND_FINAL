            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>What is the IMAHE system?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">IMAHE is an AI-powered photo sorting app that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically classify images as Good, Bad, Flagged, or Duplicate based on quality.</div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>How does IMAHE detect low-quality photos?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">IMAHE checks sharpness, exposure, and noise. Blurry, underexposed, or noisy images are automatically labeled as Bad.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="learnmore-faq-col">
            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>Can IMAHE detect closed eyes in a photo?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">Yes! The system uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and facial landmarks to flag photos where subjects have closed eyes.</div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>How are duplicate photos identified?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">IMAHE uses perceptual hashing (pHash) to compare image fingerprints and detect duplicates with high accuracy.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="learnmore-faq-col">
            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>Can I adjust the image sorting settings?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">Absolutely. Users can customize the minimum and maximum exposure and sharpness using sliders to fit their preferences.</div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-q"><b>Is my photo data safe when using IMAHE?</b></div>
            <div class="learnmore-faq-a">Yes. IMAHE works completely offline, and no photos are uploaded or shared, ensuring full privacy and data security.</div>
