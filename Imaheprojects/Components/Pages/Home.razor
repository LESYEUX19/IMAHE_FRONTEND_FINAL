                Welcome to IMAHE, your smart companion for effortless image organization.
                Just upload or drop your images into a folder — and let the power of AI do the rest!
            </p>

            @* UPDATED: Changed from five to six categories *@
            <p>✨ With IMAHE, your images are automatically analyzed and sorted into six clear categories:</p>

            <ul class="features-list">
                <li>✅ <strong>Good:</strong> These are your keepers! Clear, well-lit, and sharp photos that have passed all quality checks and are ready to be cherished.</li>
                <li>⭐ <strong>Focused:</strong> The best of the best! These are photos with a sharp, in-focus subject and a beautifully blurred background, giving them a professional, portrait-like quality.</li>

                @* UPDATED: Refined the "Blurred" description to be more specific *@
                <li>🌫️ <strong>Blurred:</strong> Photos that are out of focus or lack sharpness. Imahe helps you separate the blurry shots from the clear ones.</li>

                @* ADDED: The new "Poor Quality" category description *@
                <li>📉 <strong>Poor Quality:</strong> This category catches images that are severely under or overexposed (too dark or too bright), making them difficult to use. Imahe sets them aside for your review.</li>

                <li>😑 <strong>Closed Eye:</strong> No more ruined group shots! This folder catches photos where one or more people might be blinking, so you can easily find a better take.</li>
                <li>🔁 <strong>Duplicate:</strong> For all those burst shots and nearly identical pictures, Imahe groups them together so you can easily find the single best moment and clear out the rest.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                No more manual sorting. No more clutter.<br>
                Let IMAHE bring order to your photo chaos — quickly, intelligently, and beautifully.
